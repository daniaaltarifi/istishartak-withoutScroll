            <ul>

                otherwise, we may ask that you register with the Sites and provide us with your email
                address, phone number, a password, your first and last name and other contact

              </li>
              <li> Medical Records. To support the medical professionals giving second opinions
                regarding your health, you may be required to provide us with past and current
                medical records, description of symptoms, a medical history and life-style

              </li>
              <li>
                Technical information and usage information. Like many other websites, we collect
                information about users’ devices (such as browser and device types, device
                identification numbers, or other online identifiers) and users’ utilization and navigation
                of our Sites. This information helps us to design our Sites to better suit our users’
                needs. For example, our Sites will track the URL that you visited before you came to
                our Sites, the URL to which you next go and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We
                use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our
                Sites. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad
                demographic information.

                certain pages of our Sites. Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other
                things, saving your preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets the Sites
                remember that you’ve registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at
                our Sites, and which allows you to enter your registration information less frequently
                while visiting our Sites. We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your
                interests. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Sites to personally
                identifying information that you previously submitted, such as calling you by name
                when you return to our Sites. If your browser is set to reject cookies, or if your
                browser notifies you that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then
                your use of the Sites may not be as efficient or as enjoyable as it would be if the
                cookie were enabled. The information that we collect with cookies allows us to
                improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Sites’ usage,
                to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Sites’ content,
                layout and services. You may learn more about specific cookies later in this

<b>Your California privacy rights</b><br/><br/>

<b>The right to know and to portability </b><br/>
</p>
<p><b> You have the right to request that we disclose to you:   </b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
the categories and sources of the personal information that we collect about you, the
purposes for which we use your information and with whom such information is
shared;
  </li>
  <li>
  in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business purpose, two
separate lists where we disclose:
  </li>
  <li>
  for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category of

  </li>
  <li>
  The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected
or used over the past 12 months.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be “portable”, i.e.
delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another
entity without hindrance – provided that this is technically feasible.
</p><br/>
<p><b>The right to request the deletion of your personal information</b><br/>
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject
to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the
information is used to identify and repair errors on this Website, to detect security
incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights 
etc.). For example, we cannot delete information that explains medical treatment
decisions, as we are legally obligated to keep such information.
If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your
personal information and direct any of our service providers to do so.<br/><br/>
<b>How to exercise your privacy rights </b></p>
<p>
<b>How to make a request</b><br/>
At Istishartak, member and consumer privacy are very important to us. As a result,
before we process any requests we first must verify your identity and ensure we have
enough information. To exercise rights described throughout the Privacy Policy, you
must submit to us a “verifiable request by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  providing sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person
about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and
  </li>
  <li>
  describing your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
evaluate, and respond to it.
  </li>
  <p>
  With that in mind, at this time:
  </p>
  <li>
  Requests from Members are considered verified if submitted using our Services. If
you are an existing Member, please submit your request either by calling us and
confirming your identity, or by submitting via the application (e.g., using the chat
service, or via an open case). If, however, there is indication or suspicion of fraud or
other malicious activity on the Member’s account, we may suspend reliance on these
verification methods and defer to other methods to confirm authenticity. 

  </li>
  <li>
 You may alternatively contact us via the information provided below under “Contact
Us”. However, please note that emailed requests are not considered verified, and we
may request additional information from you (that we would already have in our
records) in order to confirm your identity. 

  </li>
  <li>
 We may also recognize verified requests submitted on an individual’s behalf by
“Authorized Agents”. To be valid, we must receive from the Agent a signed
authorization from the individual on whose behalf the Agent is acting. We will also
need to verify the authorization with the consumer.
  </li>
  <li>
For “household” requests subject to the CCPA, we will need to verify each household
Member’s individual identity and current status as household members
  </li>
  <li>
  And we will not process any requests of children under 18 years of age without
verifiable consents from their parents or legal guardians. 

  </li>
  <li>
  We will not respond to or process any unverified request. This is all done to protect
your confidentiality and ensure, to the best of our ability, that we only process such
requests for the right persons. 

  </li>
  <p>
  You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.
If you choose to exercise your privacy rights, you will not receive discriminatory
treatment or a lesser degree of service from us.
  </p>
</ul>
<p>
<b>How and when we are expected to handle your request</b><br/>
Unless otherwise specified in this Policy, the following applies for timing and
expectations around how and when we will respond to your requests. If our response
to a privacy request is restricted by an agreement between us and your Employer, we
will process your requests in accordance with that agreement and related
authorization. Otherwise, the following applies. 

To the best of our ability, we will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10
days and provide information about how we will process your request.
For CCPA-related requests, we will respond to your request within 45 days of its
receipt, and for all other requests within 30 days of receipt. Should we need more time,
we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this
regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.
Our CCPA disclosures will cover the preceding 12 month period.
Should we deny your request, we will explain to you the reasons behind our denial.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such
request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a
reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our
choices and explain the reasons behind it.<br/><br/>
